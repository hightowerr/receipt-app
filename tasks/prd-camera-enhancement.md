# PRD: Camera Screen Enhancement - Receipt Positioning Guide

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing camera screen by adding a visual guide to help users properly position their receipts before taking a picture. The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a simple, intuitive overlay that encourages better-framed photos, which will indirectly improve the accuracy of the OCR processing.

## 2. Goals

- To provide users with a clear visual guide for positioning receipts.
- To improve the overall user experience of the camera screen.
- To keep the implementation simple and functional, without adding unnecessary complexity.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to see a clear frame on the camera screen so that I know where to position my receipt for the best results.
- **As a user**, I want a simple and unobtrusive guide that helps me without getting in the way.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The camera screen must display a visual guide for positioning receipts.
2.  The guide should be a simple, semi-transparent rectangle.
3.  The guide should be visible as soon as the camera screen is loaded.
4.  The guide should be purely a visual aid and not perform any validation or logic.
5.  The guide should be visible in both light and dark modes.
6.  The guide should resize appropriately on different screen sizes.

## 5. Test-Driven Specifications

### Unit Test Requirements

- A `PositioningGuide` component should be created.
- The `PositioningGuide` component should render a styled `View` with the correct dimensions and appearance.
- The component should accept a `visible` prop to control its visibility.

### Integration Test Requirements

- The `CameraScreen` should render the `PositioningGuide` component.
- The `PositioningGuide` should be visible when the `CameraScreen` is loaded.
- The `PositioningGuide` should not interfere with the functionality of the "Take Photo" or "Select from Gallery" buttons.

### End-to-End Test Requirements

- When a user navigates to the camera tab, they should see the camera view with the positioning guide overlaid.
- The user should be able to take a photo, and the guide should not be part of the captured image.
- The user should be able to select an image from the gallery, and the guide should not interfere with this flow.

### Expected Test Scenarios

- **Happy Path:**
  - The guide is visible on the camera screen.
  - The guide is centered on the screen.
  - The guide has a semi-transparent border.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The guide resizes correctly when the device orientation changes (if applicable).
  - The guide is visible on devices with different screen aspect ratios.
- **Error Conditions:**
  - (Not applicable for a simple visual component)

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** a user is on the camera screen
  - **When** the screen loads
  - **Then** a semi-transparent rectangular guide is visible over the camera view.
- **Given** the app is in light mode
  - **When** the user navigates to the camera screen
  - **Then** the positioning guide is clearly visible.
- **Given** the app is in dark mode
  - **When** the user navigates to the camera screen
  - **Then** the positioning guide is clearly visible.

## 7. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The guide will **not** detect if a receipt is within its bounds.
- The guide will **not** automatically take a picture when a receipt is detected.
- The guide will **not** have any complex animations or interactions.

## 8. Design Considerations

- The guide should be a simple rectangle with a semi-transparent border.
- The color of the border should be easily distinguishable from the camera view in both light and dark modes.
- The guide should be implemented using the existing `ThemedView` component for consistency.

## 9. Technical Considerations

- The positioning guide should be implemented as a new, reusable component.
- The component should be styled using StyleSheet and should not rely on external libraries.

## 10. Success Metrics

- Successful implementation will be measured by the presence of the positioning guide on the camera screen and the passing of all related tests.

## 11. Open Questions

- None at this time.
