# Product Requirements Document: React Native Firebase Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will integrate React Native Firebase packages into the existing receipt scanning mobile application to connect the React Native frontend with the already-implemented Firebase backend infrastructure. The primary goal is to enable users to upload receipt images directly from the mobile app to Firebase Storage, triggering the existing OCR processing pipeline, while providing real-time feedback and comprehensive error handling.

The integration will bridge the gap between the mobile UI (currently implemented with Expo Router and themed components) and the serverless backend (Firebase Cloud Functions with Google Cloud Vision API) that is already fully operational.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Enable seamless image upload from React Native app to Firebase Storage for OCR processing
2. **Authentication Integration**: Implement Firebase Authentication to secure user interactions
3. **Real-time Experience**: Provide users with immediate feedback during upload and processing stages
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Handle all network, permission, storage, and file validation scenarios gracefully
5. **Maintain Architecture**: Build upon existing configuration and service layer patterns
6. **Type Safety**: Maintain full TypeScript integration throughout the Firebase integration

## User Stories

### Core Upload Flow

- **As a receipt scanner user**, I want to sign in with Firebase Authentication so that my receipts are securely associated with my account
- **As a mobile app user**, I want to capture a receipt photo using my device camera so that I can immediately process it for OCR
- **As a mobile app user**, I want to select an existing photo from my device gallery so that I can process previously taken receipt images
- **As an app user**, I want to see real-time upload progress so that I know my image is being processed
- **As an app user**, I want to see processing status updates so that I understand when my receipt data will be available

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **As a mobile user with poor connectivity**, I want to see a clear error message when my upload fails due to network issues
- **As a user without proper permissions**, I want to be guided to enable camera/gallery access when needed
- **As a user uploading large files**, I want to be notified if my image exceeds storage limits
- **As a user selecting invalid files**, I want immediate feedback that only image files are supported

### Authentication & Security

- **As a new user**, I want to create an account with Firebase Authentication so that I can start using the app
- **As a returning user**, I want to sign in quickly so that I can access my previous receipts and upload new ones

- **Performance Monitoring**: Firebase Performance Monitoring setup

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Consistent Theming**: All new authentication and upload screens must use existing `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` components
- **Navigation Integration**: Authentication flows must integrate seamlessly with existing Expo Router file-based routing
- **Loading States**: Upload progress and processing status must provide clear visual feedback using existing design patterns
- **Error States**: Error messages should follow the existing app's design language and color schemes

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: All authentication forms and upload interfaces must be screen reader accessible
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicators and status updates must be both visual and programmatically accessible
- **Error Announcements**: Error messages must be announced by screen readers immediately when they occur

### Platform Considerations

- **iOS Specific**: Leverage iOS-specific UI components where appropriate (blur effects, haptic feedback)
- **Android Specific**: Follow Material Design guidelines for Android-specific interactions
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure core functionality works identically across both platforms

## Technical Considerations

### React Native Firebase Integration

- **Expo Compatibility**: Ensure all Firebase packages are compatible with current Expo SDK version
- **Native Dependencies**: React Native Firebase requires native code, may need Expo development build
- **Configuration Management**: Extend existing `src/config/firebase.config.ts` without breaking current backend services
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Monitor app size increase from additional Firebase SDK packages

### Existing System Integration

- **Service Layer Consistency**: New React Native Firebase methods should follow patterns established in `src/services/firebase.ts`
- **Type Safety**: All Firebase operations must maintain TypeScript type definitions consistent with existing codebase
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Use existing error handling approaches and extend them for Firebase-specific errors
- **Testing Integration**: New tests should integrate with existing Jest and React Native Testing Library setup

### Performance Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Consider image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth and storage costs
- **Memory Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of image data and Firebase listeners to prevent memory leaks
- **Network Efficiency**: Implement appropriate retry logic and timeout handling for Firebase operations

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication Security**: Implement proper token handling and refresh mechanisms
- **Storage Security**: Ensure uploaded images use proper Firebase Storage security rules
- **Data Validation**: Validate all user inputs and file uploads before processing
- **Error Information**: Avoid exposing sensitive Firebase configuration details in error messages

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics

- **Upload Success Rate**: 95% of valid image uploads complete successfully
- **Authentication Success Rate**: 98% of valid authentication attempts succeed
- **Real-time Update Latency**: Status updates appear within 2 seconds of backend changes
- **Error Recovery Rate**: 80% of failed uploads succeed after retry

### User Experience Metrics

- **Time to First Upload**: New users can complete first receipt upload within 60 seconds of app installation
- **Upload Completion Time**: 90% of image uploads complete within 30 seconds
- **Authentication Time**: Sign-in process completes within 10 seconds for returning users
- **Error Resolution Time**: Users can understand and resolve errors within 15 seconds

### Technical Performance Metrics

- **App Startup Time**: Firebase initialization doesn't increase app startup time by more than 1 second
- **Memory Usage**: Firebase integration doesn't increase baseline memory usage by more than 20MB
- **Battery Impact**: Upload and real-time listening features don't significantly impact battery life during normal usage

## Open Questions

### Technical Implementation Questions

1. **Expo Development Build**: Will the addition of React Native Firebase packages require switching to Expo development build, and how will this affect the current development workflow?
2. **Image Compression**: Should we implement client-side image compression to reduce upload times and storage costs, or rely on server-side processing?
3. **Offline Queue**: While offline storage is out of scope, should we implement a basic queue for uploads that can be retried when connectivity returns?

### User Experience Questions

1. **Authentication Flow**: Should authentication be required immediately on app launch, or should users be able to explore the app before signing up?
2. **Progress Granularity**: What level of detail should be shown in upload progress (percentage, stages, time remaining)?
3. **Error Recovery**: Should failed uploads be automatically queued for retry, or should users manually initiate retries?

### Business Logic Questions

1. **User Data Association**: How should uploaded receipts be associated with user accounts in the existing Firestore structure?
2. **Storage Organization**: Should user-uploaded images be organized in user-specific folders within the existing `receipts/` structure?
3. **Processing Priority**: Should authenticated user uploads receive higher processing priority than anonymous uploads from the web interface?

### Testing and Deployment Questions

1. **Test Environment**: Do we need separate Firebase projects for development and production testing?
2. **Migration Strategy**: How will we handle users who may have used the app before authentication was required?
3. **Rollback Plan**: If Firebase integration causes issues, what's the rollback strategy to maintain existing web interface functionality?
